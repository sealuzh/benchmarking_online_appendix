  "body": "# Preconditions\r\nIn order to repeat our experiments, you need the following infrastructure.\r\n* linux machine with Vagrant installed\r\n* accounts for the different cloud providers. Especially AWS for hosting the CWB framework\r\n* [Cloud Workbench (CWB)](https://github.com/sealuzh/cloud-workbench)\r\n\r\n# Data Gathering and Analysis Scripts\r\n## Cookbooks\r\nIn the following, the required chef cookbooks are briefly introduced\r\n### Cookbooks which were used in the case study\r\n* acmeair_mongodb - sets up the mongodb\r\n* acmeair_wlp_morphia_distributed - sets up acmeair with wlp and mongodb driver but without a mongodb instance\r\n* acmeair-single/ - this is the cwb-jmeter benchmark (works like an adapter for jmeter-cwb)\r\n* jm-acmeair-api/ - this is the effective jmeter test plan which was used for the benchmarks\r\n* jm-acmeair-default-assets/ - this are the files needed to run the test plan\r\n* fileserver/ - this is a convenience cookbook which provides a fileserver based on spring-boot\r\n* cwb-jmeter/ - this is a cookbook which sets up  jmeter and its dependencies (is used for both, master and slave instances)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other cookbooks\r\nAll the other cookbooks in this repository were used in development or for POCs and were not used in the case study.\r\n\r\n## Example of CWB-Vagrantconfigurations\r\nExamples of complete CWB configurations can be found in the \"sample_configurations\" subfolder of this repository: [Sample Configurations](https://github.com/sealuzh/benchmarking_online_appendix/tree/master/sample_configurations)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Data Analysis Script\r\nThe script used to evaluate the data and produce the metrics discussed in the paper is available in the scripts subfolder of this repository:[Scripts](https://github.com/sealuzh/benchmarking_online_appendix/tree/master/scripts). The same script was also used to generate the plots. Data retrieval is done via Python 3.4.4 and using the SciPy library.\r\n\r\n# How To Get Started\r\n* download vagrant\r\n* setup CWB following the CWB instructions\r\n* run a first, simple benchmark on CWB\r\n* upload the cookbooks to the chef server\r\n* copy paste the AWS sample configuration and update the instance sizes you want to use\r\n* make sure to use the same AWS security group and other configurations as needed\r\n* setup a fileserver\r\n* configure the POST IP as needed\r\n* run the benchmark",
